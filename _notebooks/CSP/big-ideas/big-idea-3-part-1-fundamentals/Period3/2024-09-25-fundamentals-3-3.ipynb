    "## **Mathematical expressions** are used to perform calculations by applying arithmetic operators to variables and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in traditional math, operators such as **addition** (+), **subtraction** (-), **multiplication** (*), and **division** (/) allow programmers to manipulate data and generate results. \n",
    " \n",
    "These expressions can be as simple as adding two numbers or as complex as solving multi-step problems involving variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in many programming languages, you might see something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5 + 3\n",
    "y = 3 - 2\n",
    "z = x * y\n",
    "q = z / 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the variables x, y, z, and q hold the outcomes of various mathematical operations. By learning how to construct and evaluate mathematical expressions in code, you can create algorithms that automate calculations and solve problems efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This blog will go over the basics of mathematical expressions and how to use them efficiently in code.**"
